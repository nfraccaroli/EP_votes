# About EP Votes

EP Votes is an academic project providing insights into European Parliament voting patterns.

EP Votes is a data project started by Anatole Cheysson and Nicolò Fraccaroli. Anatole and Nicolò met in Frankfurt in 2017 and have collected data on how Members of the European Parliament vote ever since.

This project culminated in the publication of the following article, which serves as the reference work behind EP Votes:
